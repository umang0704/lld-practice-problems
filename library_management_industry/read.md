# Library Management System Backend

This project aims to build a scalable, robust Library Management System backend using Spring Boot. The system will handle millions of users while maintaining high performance and adhering to industry standards.

## **Phases of Development**

### **Phase 1: Basic System Setup**
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up a Spring Boot project using Maven/Gradle.
   - Include dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2/MySQL.
   
2. **Core Functionalities**
   - CRUD operations for `Book` and `User` entities.
   - REST APIs for managing books and users.

3. **Database Integration**
   - Start with an embedded H2 database for development.
   - Define schemas for `Book` and `User`.

4. **Testing**
   - Write basic unit and integration tests.

---

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
1. **Search Functionality**
   - Implement APIs to search books by title, author, or genre.
   - Add pagination and sorting support.

2. **Borrowing and Returning Books**
   - Add `BorrowedBooks` entity to track user activity.
   - Implement APIs for borrowing and returning books.

3. **Validation and Constraints**
   - Enforce input validations using Hibernate Validator.
   - Add borrowing limits per user.

---

### **Phase 3: Scalability and Performance**
1. **Database Optimization**
   - Migrate to MySQL/PostgreSQL.
   - Add indexes for frequently queried fields.

2. **Distributed Caching**
   - Integrate Redis for caching book details and search results.
   - Implement cache invalidation for consistency.

3. **Search Optimization**
   - Introduce Elasticsearch for full-text search.
   - Enable advanced search with filters.

---

### **Phase 4: Microservices Architecture**
1. **Service Segmentation**
   - Split the system into microservices:
     - **User Service**: Manages users and authentication.
     - **Book Service**: Handles book inventory and search.
     - **Borrowing Service**: Tracks borrowing and returning books.

2. **API Gateway**
   - Use Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests.
   - Centralize API authentication and request throttling.

3. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Use REST or gRPC for communication between microservices.

---

### **Phase 5: Robust Authentication and Authorization**
1. **Authentication**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for user authentication.
   - Support user roles (Admin, User) for role-based access.

2. **Authorization**
   - Restrict access to sensitive operations (e.g., adding books).

---

### **Phase 6: Asynchronous Processing**
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Integrate RabbitMQ/Kafka for asynchronous processing.
   - Publish events for borrow/return operations.

2. **Notification Service**
   - Implement a service to notify users when a book is available.

---

### **Phase 7: Observability and Monitoring**
1. **Centralized Logging**
   - Integrate ELK Stack for log aggregation and analysis.

2. **Metrics Monitoring**
   - Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics.

3. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Implement tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin for inter-service calls.

---

### **Phase 8: Fault Tolerance and Resilience**
1. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Add retry logic for database and API calls.

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Handle service failures gracefully using circuit breakers.

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Protect APIs using rate-limiting strategies.

---

### **Phase 9: Deployment and Scalability**
1. **Containerization**
   - Containerize the application using Docker.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

3. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Deploy to AWS, GCP, or Azure.
   - Use managed services for databases, caching, and queues.
